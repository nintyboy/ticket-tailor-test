# Ticket Tailor Test

Hi all, I recommend running a simple HTTP Server
```
python3 -m http.server 3000
```

Or if you're running VS code use the extenstion: [Live Preview](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.live-server)

I've popped the event data in to `Data/(simple | complex).json` and it can throw a CORS issue if you just try and open index.html.
